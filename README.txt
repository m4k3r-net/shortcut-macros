The Shortcut Macros plugin allows you to set up a shortcut for text or links that you use often - saves typing.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Put the 'shortcut-macros.php' file into your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Shortcut Macros.
4. Go to Options > Macros to create your macros.


== Usage ==

When creating a post/page, enter a macro that you have set up (##example). When the post is saved (as a draft or published), this macro will be automatically expanded to the full text you have set up for it.


== Known Issues ==

This works only in the body of the post/page, not the title.
